================
PHPillow read me
================

PHPillow is an object orientated wrapper for CouchDB__.

__ http://couchdb.org/

Prerequisites
=============

The following prerequisites must be fulfilled to use PHPillow:

- A running CouchDB installation from current trunk.

  We already adapted the library to the current changes for 0.8, so that it
  won't work any more with the latest released version 0.7.2.

- PHP 5.3

  Since this is a wrapper for alpha software, which won't be stable really soon
  and some of the features in PHP 5.3 (LSB) are useful for the implementation,
  we decided to work with PHP 5.3 as a prerequisite. It won't run and won't be
  ported to any older version of PHP. Don't even think of PHP 4.

  There aren't any non-default extensions or settings required for PHP.

State
=====

The library will stay in an alpha state at least as long as CouchDB is still
alpha. We do not know about changes in API or storage mechanisms in CouchDB, so
that we can't guarantee that the PHPillow API will stay completely stable, but
we will try to keep backwards compatibility.

License
=======

For the license we have chosen the LGPL 3 as a license. This license gives you
a lot rights on the source code with limitations we know and have chosen
intentionally.

wrapper.
