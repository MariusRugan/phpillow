Introduction
============

CouchDB__ is a document based database. From their website:

    CouchDB is a document-oriented, Non-Relational DataBase Management Server
    (NRDBMS). The CouchDb Quick Overview has a high level overview of the
    CouchDB system.

More detailed information can be found at here__.

Documents
=========

As noted above the central object we have to deal with are documents.

Define a custom document
------------------------

All documents extend the abstract base class phpillowDocument. A
complete model defining a blog entry could look like::

    class myBlogDocument extends phpillowDocument
    {
        protected static $type = 'blog_entry';

        protected $requiredProperties = array(
            'title',
            'text',
        );

        protected function __construct()
        {
            $this->properties = array(
                'title'     => new phpillowStringValidator(),
                'text'      => new phpillowTextValidator(),
                'comments'  => new phpillowDocumentArrayValidator(
                    'myBlogComments'
                ),
            );

            parent::__construct();
        }

        protected function generateId()
        {
            return $this->stringToId( $this->storage->title );
        }
    }

The static property $type defines the type of the stored document and should be
unique in the whole application. If you are implementing a module, prefix this
type with the name of the module, like "blog" in this example.

The array $requiredProperties defined the properties, which are mandatory to
be set. The properties itself are defined in the $properties property, which
is initialized in the constructor of the document. We associate a validator
with each property which validates the input set on the document. There are
quite complex validators, like the phpillowDocumentArrayValidator shown here,
which will be described later, which are all documented in the generated API
documentation.

The last thing you need to define is the generation of the document ID. An ID
in CouchDB needs to fullfill some requirements, which are ensured by using the
protected method stringToId(). Normally you use one somehow unqiue property of
the document. If this is not entirely unique the document handler will append
something, so taht it will get unique.

Using a document
----------------

With a document definition like above you can use the document in your code as
simple as::

    $doc = new myBlogDocument();
    $doc->title = 'New blog post';
    $doc->text  = 'Hello world.';
    $doc->save();

With the call to save() the document will be generated and stored in the
database. After this a new magic property is available for the document::

    echo $doc->_id;
    > blog_entry-new_blog_post

Using documents directly this ID is the way to fetch the document back from the
database, like::

    $doc = myBlogDocument::fetchById( 'blog_entry-new_blog_post' );

This call retrieved the above document back from the database. The magic
CouchDB properties _id and _rev (for revision) are set for the document. Beside
the defined properties another property has been created by the wrapper, called
revisions, which contains all old (and the current) revisions of the document::

    echo $doc->revisions[0]->title;
    > New blog post

If you now change a property on the object and store it again in the database
the old revision will also be stored in the database, so that no information is
lost on change. This behaviour may be deactivated by setting the $versioned
property to false.

Views
=====

Views in CouchDb are a way to index and access documents by their properties,
perhaps filtered, or by complex self defined keys. Views for our documents
extend the view base class phpillowView, and implement the view logic
as EcmaScript, executed on the server (currently using the SpiderMonkey
implementation). A view definition for our blog entries could look like::

    class myBlogView extends phpillowView
    {
        protected $viewDefinitions = array(
            // Index blog entries by their title, and list all comments
            'entries' => 'function( doc )
    {
        if ( doc.type == "blog_entry" )
        {
            map( doc.title, doc._id );

            map( [doc._id, 0], doc._id );
            for ( var i = 0; i < doc.comments.length; ++i )
            {
                map( [doc._id, 1], doc.comments[i] );
            }
        }
    }',
        );

        protected static function getViewName()
        {
            return 'blog_entries';
        }
    }

For detailed information how views work, you should read the `CouchDB
documentation on views`__, but the here implemented shows some nice features of
CouchDB views.

__ http://www.couchdbwiki.com/index.php?title=Views

All view definitions are stored in the property $viewDefinitions and are
automatically written to the database. The view has a name, which is used to
identify the set of views in the database and does not really matter.

In one view the defined EcmaScript should only operate on one type of
documents, but is not forced to do so. The CouchDB function map() takes a key and
some content as paramters and indexes the given content by the given key. The
first call to map indexes all blog entries by their title, a simple string to
string index. As views are also completely generated you should not store the
entire documents, but only the ID, as shown above. You may now fetch the
document by its original title::

    $doc = myBlogView::entries( array( 'key' => 'New blog post' ) );

The next two map functions create a complex index, so you may retreive the IDs
of one blog entry and all comments related to that blog entry with one query::

    $docs = myBlogView::entries( array(
        'startkey'  => array( 'blog_entry-new_blog_post', 0 ),
        'endkey'    => array( 'blog_entry-new_blog_post', 1 ),
    ) );

For details why and how this works you may want to read the section on `view
collation`__ in the CouchDB wiki.

The manager
===========

The manager provides a central registry for couchDB documents and views. You
may set and overwrite the document class for one document type, or query this
document class directly, whatever class has been set for it, like::

    $doc = phpillowManager::createDocument( 'blog_entry' );
    // ...

    $doc = phpillowManager::fetchDocument(
        'blog_entry', 'blog_entry-new_blog_post'
    );
    // ...

The same is true for views.
